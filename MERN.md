MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js

MongoDB: doc based open source database
Express: Web application framework for node js
React: JS front end library for building UI
Node Js: Runtime env that executres JS code outside of a browser, like on a sever
Mongoose: Schema based solution to model app data



Database Concepts

Tabular vs MongoDB
Table = Collection
Row = Document
Join = $lookup
Foreign Key = ReferenceNotes

MongoDB document looks a lot like JSON
Stored in BSON (Binary JSON)


Client -> R -> EN -> M
Express and Node is back end
MongoDB is database
React is front end

React is similar to Vue, MongoDB similar to MySQL
Thinking mongoose is similar to artisan
